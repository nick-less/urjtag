UrJTAG
======

Software for `JTAG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG>`

Project homepage is at http://urjtag.org

Mailinglist is the primary communication channel


Notes:

This has the spi patch from https://sourceforge.net/p/urjtag/mailman/message/26576678/ together with support 
for more SPI devices. Some MacOS build issues were also corrected.

You may need a newer bison, but not to new (2.3 & 2.4 do not work, 3.0.4 and 3.0.5 do, 3.2.4 doesn't)
